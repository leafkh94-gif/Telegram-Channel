Smart-money liquidity sweep detector.

A bearish sweep: price briefly pierces a recent swing low (stop hunt), then
the bar closes back above that low → institutional buyers absorbed the sells
→ signal is 'buy'.

A bullish sweep: price briefly pierces a recent swing high, closes back below
→ signal is 'sell'.
